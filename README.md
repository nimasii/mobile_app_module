# Overview

This is a program that I wrote to learn the basics of Android Studio and Koltin. This was my first attempt at coding in both Android Studio and Koltin. I created a very basic war card game. Two cards will be drawn every time the draw button is hit. Whichever player drew the higher card gains a point. If the cards are equal, it is a draw and no points are rewarded.

# Development Environment

I developed this program in Koltin language in the Android Studio environment. Here is a list of imported libraries I used in this project.
* import androidx.appcompat.app.AppCompatActivity
* import android.os.Bundle
* import android.view.View
* import android.widget.Button
* import android.widget.ImageView
* import android.widget.TextView
* import kotlin.random.Random

# Future Work

* Add logic so the game acts like war when two cards of identical values are drawn.
* Create an actual deck that can be shuffled, and have cards removed.
* Add a win condition when a player wins all the cards.
